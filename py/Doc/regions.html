<h2>Fitting and Noise Calculation Regions</h2>
The fitting region (shown by the green vertical lines on the plotted
data) indicates which part of the data is to be fit.
Similarly, the noise calculation region (yellow lines) indicates which
part of the data is to be used for calculating the noise level.
<p>
By default, the fitting region includes all of the data from
the start of the voltage step to the end of the voltage step,
and the noise calculation region includes the last tenth
of the voltage step.
This is the situation shown in Figure 1.
If there is contamination in some of the data (for example at the start of
the voltage step) the fitting region may need to be adjusted to exclude
some data. 
The noise calculation region should encompass a reasonable number of
points within the voltage step where the data traces are
mostly flat, and may need to be adjusted to accomplish this.

<p>
The fitting and noise calculation regions 
can be adjusted for all of the data of one type (varying
steps or varying presteps), for each file
individually, or for each sweep individually
by first selecting the appropriate data with the selection bars
and then using the mouse to move the 
sliders at the bottom of the plotting area.
<p>
The data and regions currently displayed on the plot are indicated
by the orange highlighted data selection bar at the left of the data
description area.
There are three levels.
The leftmost bar encompasses all of the data from all
of the specified files, the middle bars encompass
individual files, and the rightmost bars are for each individual sweep
within a file.
Adjusting a region at a particular level will apply that new region
to all lower levels which have not themselves been adjusted.
In the situation shown in Figure 2, all of the data has been
selected, we have
<a href="zoom.html">zoomed</a> in near time zero and then have shifted
the start of the fitting region so that approximately the first
millisecond of data, where the recorded current is negative due to
contamination, will be excluded from the fit.
Note that once a region has been adjusted, the sliders and reset
button are outlined in 
black and the data selection bar has black diagonal stripes.

<p>
To change the fitting region for just one sweep, first
select that sweep by clicking on the appropriate rightmost bar
and then adjust the fitting region.
To return a region to its default setting at a particular level,
first select the appropriate data and then click on the "reset"
button at the bottom left of the plot.
