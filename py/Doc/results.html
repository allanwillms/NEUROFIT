<h2>Fitting Results Panel</h2>
The Fitting Results Panel has five display fields and a scrollable message
window.

After fitting the data, the number of function evaluations, the number
of jacobian evaluations, the total number of data points used in the
fit, and the number of fitted parameters are displayed.  
In addition, the noise scaled variance of the fit is
displayed.  This latter value is a measure of the goodness of the fit;
the closer to 1 the better.
Specifically, the noise scaled variance is the 
sum of the squares of the ratio of the difference between the
data and the fit and the noise level.
Therefore, a value of 5.0 indicates that the error in the 
fit is about five times the size of the noise.
A value of 1.0 is as good as one could hope for, although values less
than 1.0 are possible if the noise is not truly Gaussian or if the
noise level is over-estimated.  Conversely, non-Gaussian noise or
an under-estimated noise level may result in a noise scaled variance
which is higher than it should be.
It is possible to have relatively high values (on the order of 10)
for the noise scaled
variance and still have a visually good fit of the data, particularly if,
say, just the peaks are missed by the fitted curves.
The percentage contribution of each sweep to the overall variance is 
displayed to the right of each sweep number in the
<a href="datadisp.html">Data Display Panel</a>.
<p>
When the user asks NEUROFIT to fit the data, there are several possible
outcomes.  The algorithm may terminate with
<ul>
<li> an ERROR indicating that one or more
of the initial guesses or input specifications is invalid.
<li> a WARNING due to having reached the 
maximum number of specified function evaluations.
<li> an INFO message indicating successful convergence.
<li> a WARNING if it determines that the specified tolerance levels are
too small and no further improvement can be made
due to the limits of machine precision.
</ul>
(See the <a href="algspecs.html">Algorithm Specifications Panel</a>
for an explanation of how the tolerance levels control convergence.)
<p>
In addition, there are two other WARNING messages that may be issued
along with any of the above.  
<ol>
<li> A warning indicating that the noise window specifications 
permit noise estimates on some but not all of the sweeps.
This message is displayed if the noise window for one or more (but not all)
sweeps contains less points than the degree of the noise 
polynomial plus one. 
Since a noise level for each sweep must be present for noise adjustment
to be made, no adjustment is made in this case, but all noise levels are
set to 1.0.
<li> A warning indicating that the Jacobian matrix is singular
at the solution.  This message indicates that the solution is
essentially unaffected by the value of one or more of the parameters.
It typically occurs when the algorithm fails to converge and one or more
parameters gets pushed to a boundary value, or when the data is not
sufficiently sensitive to that parameter.
The parameter(s) which cause this are indicated by a standard error
of 0.0.
