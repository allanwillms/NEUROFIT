<h2>Model Parameters Panel</h2>

A list of all of the parameters is given in the Model Parameters Panel,
which is a scrollable region at the bottom left of the window.  
The meaning of each parameter is explained in the 
<a href="math.html">Mathematical Model</a>.
The values of <em>n</em><sub>h</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>nonh</sub> (set 
in the <a href="modelspecs.html">Model Specifications Panel</a>)
dictate whether the parameters <em>V</em><sub>2h</sub>,
<em>s</em><sub>h</sub>, and <em>f<sub>i</sub></em> are present.
In addition, <em>n</em><sub>h</sub> and the step potential levels 
in the data files dictate which time constant parameters are present.
<p>
To the left of each parameter name is
a tick box indicating whether this parameter is to be varied (default)
or held constant.
To the right of each parameter there
are three fields specifying: an initial value, 
a final fitted value, and a standard error.
The units for each parameter are also given.  To change these units, see
<a href="units.html">Measurement Units</a>.
<p>
There are transfer buttons for each parameter between the initial and
fitted value columns which when
clicked transfer the fitted value to the intial value.  A transfer
button at the top of the list can be used to transfer all of the values at
once.  It is not uncommon for the fitting results to be good for some 
parameters but poor for others.  
In this case a better fit can usually be obtained by
transferring the fitted values to the
initial values, adjusting those that are unreasonable and then re-fitting 
the data.
<p>
As with any nonlinear least squares algorithm, a set of initial guesses for
the varying parameters must be supplied before a full fit can be done.
To aid in the selection of initial values,
the "Quick Fit" option can be used.
The quick fit option requires only an initial value for
<em>E</em><sub>rev</sub> to be supplied, and can be used to get 
the program to do a fast rough fit of the data, the results of which are 
displayed in the fitted value column and on the plots.
The transfer button can then be used to transfer these values to
the initial value column and a full fit can be done.
The results from the quick fit may not be very accurate and may require the
user to modify them somewhat in order for the full nonlinear fit
to converge.
<p>
The two green buttons at the top of the model parameters panel will
instruct the program to do a fit of the specified data.  These functions
can also be obtained from the <a href="menus.html">Data Menu</a>.
<p>
The standard error for each fitted parameter is displayed in the rightmost
column.  A large standard error typically means the data is insensitive to
a particular parameter value.
Additionally, if the data is extremely insensitive to a parameter, the
Jacobian matrix may be singular.  In this case a warning message is
displayed in the <a href="results.html">Fitting Results Panel</a> and the
standard errors of the offending parameters are set to 0.0.
