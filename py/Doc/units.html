<h2>Measurement Units</h2>
There are three fundamental dimensions associated with
the data and parameters:
time, current, and voltage.  In addition, there is a derived dimension:
conductance=current/voltage.
The base units used for these dimensions are SI: seconds, Amperes, Volts.
<h3>Project Units</h3>

A NEUROFIT project carries a set of units for the fundamental 
dimensions
and all display and computation is performed with these units.  
The project
units can be changed (thus scaling the affected data and parameter values)
by selecting "Measurement Units..." from the 
<a href="menus.html">Data Menu</a>.
Note that scaling the voltage will also affect the names of the time
constant parameters.
The conductance parameters will be adjusted appropriately whenever the
voltage or current units are changed.
<p>
If you have opened a new project, the project units will initially be
undefined.  If they are not defined by specifying them as described above,
then the units for the first file read in will be used as the project
units.

<h3>File Units</h3>
<table width=100%><tr><td>
The data in each file also carries (explicitly for <code>abf</code> files,
implicitly for text files) a set of units for the fundamental
dimensions of time, current and voltage.
Data for each file is scaled to the project units before displaying
and computation.
<p>
If a file is
an <code>abf</code> file, the units for time, current, and voltage will be 
determined from the file's header (or directly from the user if it
cannot be determined from the header for some reason).
If a file is a text file,
you will be required to specify the units for the time and the
current when you first select the file, see
<a href="fileselect.html">Data File Selection</a>.
Voltage units are
specified later when voltage levels are entered, see 
<a href="voltagespecs.html">Voltage and Voltage Step Specifications</a>.
