<h3>Zoom Menu Button</h3>
The zoom menu button is located at the top of the plot as shown at the
right.
It translates and scales the data so that within the plot you see:
<ul>
<li> the data within the voltage step
<li> all of the data
<li> a custom user-defined portion of the data (disabled until the
custom view has been set).
<li> The last entry defines the custom zoom setting as whatever is
currently displayed on the plot.
</ul>
If one of the three settings, "step", "all", or "custom" is currently being
viewed, then that selection is shown in blue on the menu.
