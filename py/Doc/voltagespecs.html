<h2>Voltage and Voltage Step Specificatons</h2>
It is only necessary to enter this information manually if
the data is from an ASCII text file.
If the data is from abf files, this information is determined from
those files.

<h3>Voltage Levels</h3>
Voltage levels for each data file
are specified by clicking on the
"Voltages..." button at the top of the data description area 
for each type of data (varying step or varying prestep) in the
<a href="datadisp.html">Data Display Panel</a>,
or by choosing "Voltage Levels" from the pull-down
<a href="menus.html">Data Menu</a>.
For varying step data files, both the prestep voltage and
the step voltage for each sweep within the file are required.
Different files may have different prestep or step levels.
Simillarly, for varying prestep data files, both the step voltage
and the prestep voltage for each sweep within the file are required.
<p>
The units refer to the numbers specified in this panel.  If the project
units are different, these values will be scaled appropriately before
being used/displayed in the rest of the program. (See 
<a href="units.html">Measurement Units</a>.)
<h3>Voltage Step Start and End Times</h3>
The start and end times of the voltage step are specified by holding down
the control key and clicking on the plot at the appropriate location
with the left mouse button (for the start) and right mouse button (for the
end).
You may need to <a href="zoom.html">zoom</a> in first.
Note that start and end times specified in this manner only apply to
data from text files, and only apply to the data currently being displayed.
Use the selection bars to select the appropriate data before setting the
start and end times.  It is therefore possible to specify identical
start and end times for all sweeps, or, different start
and end times for each sweep if necessary.
