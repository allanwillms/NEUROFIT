The code which performs the nonlinear least squares fitting is a C
translation and adaptation of an implementation of the 
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm written in Fortran and freely available from the
<a href="http://www.netlib.org/">Netlib Mathematical Software Repository</a>
(lmder.f).
The translation was done by Howie Kuo and adaptations to allow for linear
inequality constraints was completed by 
Allan Willms.  The remainder of the code for the nonlinear fitting 
algorithm, and all of the code for the quick fit linear algorithm was 
written by Allan Willms.
The user interface was written by Greg Ewing and Allan Willms using 
the Python interpretive language
(freely available from
<code><a href="http://python.org/">http://python.org/</a></code>).
A Python interpreter is bundled as part of the NEUROFIT package.
