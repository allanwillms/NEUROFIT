<h2><a name="QG">Quick Guide</a></h2>
Steps for using NEUROFIT:
<ol>
<li><strong>Open</strong> an existing project from the 
<a href="menus.html">File Menu</a> 
or define a <strong>New</strong> project (default).
<li><strong>Specify data</strong>:
<ul type="disc">
<li><a href="fileselect.html">Select Data Files</a> 
from the 
<a href="menus.html">Data Menu</a>.  
There are two types of
data files, those which contain data from experiments with varying step
potentials, and those from experiments with varying pre-step potentials.
You may specify zero, one, or more files for each type.
Data files may either be in Axon Binary Format (<code>abf</code>) 
or ASCII text files with the data in columns.
(See <a href="dataformat.html">Data File Formats</a>.)
If you are using text files, a window will appear in which you specify
the 
<a href="units.html">units</a>
for the data in the files.
All of the data will be plotted in the two panels on the right.
(You may view selected files or sweeps by clicking on the appropriate
selection
bars in the panels to the left of the plotted data. The orange highlighted
bar indicates which data is currently being viewed.  See the 
<a href="datadisp.html">Data Display Panel</a>.)
<li> If the data files are <code>abf</code> format, the
voltage levels and the start and end times of the voltage step will 
be determined from the files.  For each text format data file, you
will need to:<br>
<a href="voltagespecs.html">Set voltages and voltage step start and 
end time points</a>:<br>
This is done by clicking on the "Voltages..." button above the displayed
data.
Once the voltages are specified, the time constants for each voltage level
will appear in the parameter panel at the bottom left.
Use &lt;<code>ctrl</code>&gt;-left mouse button to locate the start of the 
voltage step on the plot, and &lt;<code>ctrl</code>&gt;-right 
mouse button to locate the
end of the voltage step.  It is essential that the limits of the 
voltage step be determined in this way.
(See <a href="zoom.html">Zooming</a> for how to zoom in/out on the data.)
<li>Exclude unwanted sweeps.  To the left of each sweep number in the
<a href="datadisp.html">Data Display Panel</a>
there is a dot which
indicates whether that sweep is to be included (dark blue) or not (light
blue).
Clicking on the dot toggles the sweep on and off.  In this way,
sweeps within a file which contain no useful data can be easily
excluded.  (Note that the colour of the plotted data matches the toggle
switch.)
If you turn off a sweep and it is the only one at a particular 
step potential, you will need to make sure the corresponding time
constant parameters are turned off, that is, not fit. (See "Set Model 
Parameter information" below.)
</ul>
<li><strong>Set <a href="modelspecs.html">Model Specifications</a></strong>:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Specify values for the number of inactivating channel groups and the
number of non-inactivating channel groups (the two grey boxes top left)
by first clicking on the grey field.
<li>Specify the number of independent activation gates (p).
</ul>
<li><strong>Set <a href="algspecs.html">Algorithm Specifications</a></strong>.  
(In many situations the default values should be sufficient.)
<li><strong>Set <a href="regions.html">Fitting and Noise Calculation 
Regions</a></strong>:
<ul type="disc">
<li>The fitting regions (shown by the green vertical lines on the plotted data)
indicate which part of the included data are to be fit.
By default, the fitting region includes the entire trace from
the start of the voltage step to the end of the voltage step.
These regions can be reduced in size (for example, to eliminate noisy data
at the start of the voltage step) by moving the handles at the bottom of
the plots.
The fitting region is initially the same for all files and all sweeps.
To change it for all files and sweeps, simply click on the leftmost 
selection bar before adjusting the region. 
To change the region for just one file, or just one sweep within a file,
first click on the appropriate selection bar so that the desired file/sweep is
shown before adjusting the region.
Stripes in the selection bar indicate that the region for the corresponding
data has been altered from the default.  
To reset the region to the default, click on the appropriate striped
selection bar and then click on the "reset" button at the bottom left
of the plot.
<li>The noise calculation region (shown by the yellow vertical lines on
the plotted data) should enclose a relatively flat portion
of the data from which an independent estimate of the noise will be made.
These regions are adjusted in a similar manner to the fitting regions.
(The data in these regions will be fit to a polynomial of degree as
specified in the 
<a href="algspecs.html">Algorithm Specifications Panel</a>.)
</ul>
<li><strong>Set <a href="parms.html">Model Parameter</a> information</strong>:
<ul type="disc">
<li>For each parameter specify whether it should be fit (default) or held
constant at its initial value, by using the check boxes to the left of 
the parameter name in the <a href="parms.html">Model Parameters Panel</a>.
<li>Specify any required initial values.
"Full Fit" requires initial values for <em>all</em>
parameters, while "Quick Fit" requires an initial value
for just the reversal potential, <em>E</em><sub>rev</sub>, and
any parameters that are held constant.
</ul>
<li><strong>Fit the data</strong>:
<ul type="disc">
<li> Clicking on the "Quick Fit" button does a quick, linear, rough fit
of the data.  It is mostly useful for generating initial values for
a Full Fit.
The results from "Quick Fit" will be placed in the fitted
value column and the resulting curves will be plotted.
You can transfer the fitted values (all or individually) to the initial 
value column using the transfer buttons.
Note that some of values obtained by "Quick Fit" may be unreasonable 
(especially inactivation time constants if <em>n</em><sub>h</sub> is 
greater than one)
and may need manual modification before doing a Full Fit.
<li> Clicking on the "Full Fit" button does a full, nonlinear fit
of the data using the initial values of the parameters as a starting
point.
The quality of the initial values will influence the speed and 
accuracy of the fitting algorithm, but generally, the results from
"Quick Fit" will be sufficient.
(As an additional aid to obtaining better initial values,
set the Numerical Specification "Max Function Evals" to 1 and then
click on the "Full Fit" button.  This forces the algorithm to
terminate after one evaluation and has the effect of simply plotting the
curves indicated by the initial values overtop the data.  Be sure
to reset Max Function Evals to a reasonable number before proceding.)
Fitting results will be displayed in the 
<a href="results.html">Fitting Results Panel</a>, bottom right,
and in the <a href="parms.html">Model Parameters Panel</a>.
</ul>
<li><strong>Save the results</strong>:
<ul type="disc">
<li> Selecting "Save" or "Save As" from the 
<a href="menus.html">File Menu</a>
will save your current settings and values in a NEUROFIT project file 
(extension "nfp").  This file can later be opened from NEUROFIT and
further processing of the data completed.
It is recommended that you do not save any project files in
the NEUROFIT directory itself, otherwise, you risk losing those
files if and when you download and install a newer version
of the NEUROFIT software.
<li> Selecting "Save Report" from the 
<a href="menus.html">File Menu</a>
will create a readable formatted text file giving information on
the data and the fitting results.
This file is intended for viewing/printing.
