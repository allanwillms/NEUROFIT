<h2>Data File Formats</h2>
Data files may be in either Axon Binary Format (abf) or ASCII text format
with the data in columns.
<p>
The Axon Binary Format is a proprietary format developed by 
<a target="_top" href="http://www.axon.com/">Axon Instruments</a>.
It is the default format generated by their various cellular neuroscience
software products, including pClamp.
It is best to use these files with NEUROFIT, since they contain
information on the voltage levels and start and stop times of the 
voltage steps which would otherwise have to be entered manually if 
text files are used.
<p>
NEUROFIT can also read plain text files.  Here the assumption is
that the data is in columns.  The first column contains the time
and subsequent columns contain the electrical current; one additional column
for each sweep.
If text data files are used, it
is the user's responsibility to correctly specify the start and end 
times of the voltage step, and the voltage
levels.
