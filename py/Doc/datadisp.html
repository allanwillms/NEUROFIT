<h2>Data Display Panel</h2>
The Data Display Panel has two plotting areas and two corresponding data
description areas.
The upper areas are for data from voltage-clamp experiments with a constant
prestep potential but varying step potentials, 
while the lower areas are for data from experiments with varying prestep 
potentials but a constant step potential.

<h3>Data Description Area</h3>
The scrollable area to the left of the plot for each type of data presents
information on the files selected and all of the data within each file.
You may specify multiple files for each type of data, although
one file for each type is typical for an inactivating current, and
this is the situation displayed to the right.
<h5>File names and voltage levels</h5>
For the varying step potential data, each file contains a number of 
voltage-clamp experiments (sweeps) each with the same prestep potential.
The name of the file and the prestep potential for that file are given
above a list of each of the sweep numbers and their corresponding step
potentials.
If the data files are ABF files 
(see <a href="dataformat.html">Data File Formats</a>) then this
information is read from the file header.
If the data files are text files then the user must enter the
voltage levels by clicking on the "Voltages..." button above the plot, or
selecting "Voltage Levels" from the
<a href="menus.html">Data Menu</a>.
If multiple files are used they may each have a different prestep potential.
<h5>Sweep in/exclusion</h5>
To the left of each sweep number there is a dot which
indicates whether that sweep is to be included (dark blue) or not (light
blue).
Clicking on the dot toggles the sweep on and off.  In this way,
sweeps within a file which contain no useful data can be easily
ignored.  The plotted data has the corresponding colour coding.
(Note that the sweep is still plotted, but the 
data in that sweep is not fit.)
<h5>Data Selection for viewing and plot functions</h5>
On the far left of the Data Description Area 
are a sequence of three types of data selection bars.  
The orange highlighted bar indicates which data is currently
being shown in the Data Plot Area.
The leftmost bar selects all of the sweeps from all of the files,
the middle bars select all of the sweeps from just one file, and the
rightmost bars select individual sweeps.
Note that these bars do not affect what data is fit, only what is
displayed.
The currently selected data also determines how the 
<a href="regions.html">fitting and noise calculation region</a> 
sliders work (green and yellow sliders on the plots), and
to which data 
<a href="voltagespecs.html">voltage step strart and end time specifications</a> 
apply.
<h5>Sweep specific output</h5>
On the far right of the Data Description Area are two columns which are
filled in after a fit has completed.
The column labelled "Noise" gives the noise level for each sweep.
The noise level is the standard deviation of the fit of the data
in the <a href="regions.html">Noise Calculation Region</a>
to a polynomial of order specified
in the <a href="algspecs.html">Algorithm Specifications Panel</a>.
The column labelled "Var%" gives the percentage contribution of that
sweep to the overall variance of the fit.
<p>
For the varying prestep potential data, the description area is
similar expect that the step potential for each file is given above
a list of the prestep potentials for each sweep.
<h3>Data Plot Area</h3>
The data selected by the orange highlighted data selection bar
is plotted in the plot area.
All data that lies outside the regime of the model, that is, data recorded
from before the voltage step started or after it ended, is plotted in grey.
Data recorded during the voltage step is plotted in either dark blue, if
the sweep is to be included in the fitting, or light blue if it is not.
After a fit has completed, the fitted curves are plotted over top the 
data in red.
<p>
If the data files are text format, then the start and end time of the voltage
step are initially set to be the first and last data point.
The correct start and end times must be manually specified before fitting.  
See <a href="voltagespecs.html">Voltage and Voltage Step Specifications</a>.
<p>
By default, the axes are initially set to display all of the data within
the voltage step.
It is possible to change the view of the data by using the
"Zoom" button above the plot or using the mouse to drag out a box.
See <a href="zoom.html">Zooming</a>.
<p>
At the bottom of the Data Plot Area there are two sets of movable sliders,
green and yellow, which specify the 
<a href="regions.html">Fitting and Noise Calculation Regions</a> respectively,
and two buttons for resetting these regions to their defaults.
