There are three values that need to be filled in to specify the model:
<ol>
<li>
The number of inactivating channel groups (<i>n</i><sub>h</sub> )</li>
<li>
The number of non-inactivating channel groups (<i>n</i><sub>nonh</sub>
)</li>
<li>
The number of independent activation gates ( <i>p</i> )</li>
</ol>
1. The number of inactivating channel groups must be an integer between
zero and three. As <i>n</i><sub>h</sub> increases, the problem of fitting
the data becomes ill-posed and satisfactory results are unlikely.
<p>2. The number of non-inactivating channel groups must be either zero
or one, but must be one if <i>n</i><sub>h</sub> is zero.&nbsp; For example,
to fit data from a channel which has no inactivation, set
<i>n</i><sub>h</sub>
to zero and <i>n</i><sub>nonh</sub> to one. For data which has two time
constants of inactivation and a residual non-inactivating component, set
<i>n</i><sub>h</sub> to two and
<i>n</i><sub>nonh</sub> to one.
<p>3. The number of independent activation gates can be any positive integer.
Although this number has historically been often set to three or four,
unless your data shows a distinct delay in the rise of the current at the
start of the voltage step, <i>p</i> should be set to one.
<p>See the <a href="math.html">Mathematical Model</a> for a complete explanation
of how these parameters affect the specification of the model.
